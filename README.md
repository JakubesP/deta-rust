## Testing

**Unit tests:**
```rust
cargo test --lib
```

**Integration tests:**

Before performing integration tests, you must create a `.env` file in the root directory. It should contain the fields:

```
API_KEY=[...]
TEST_DB_NAME=[...]
TEST_DRIVE_NAME=[...]
```

Then:

```rust
cargo test --test database
cargo test --test drive
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note, make sure that the database or drive under test does not contain any relevant data ‚ö†Ô∏è
